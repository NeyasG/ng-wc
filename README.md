Personal project to build my own version of the wc unix command line tool

- **Github repository**: <https://github.com/NeyasG/ng-wc/>
- **Documentation** <https://NeyasG.github.io/ng-wc/>

## Getting started with your project

### 1. Create a New Repository

First, create a repository on GitHub with the same name as this project, and then run the following commands:

```bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:NeyasG/ng-wc.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

Then, install the environment and the prek hooks with

```bash
make install
```

This will also generate your `uv.lock` file

### 3. Run the prek hooks

Initially, the CI/CD pipeline might be failing due to formatting issues. To resolve those run:

```bash
uv run prek run -a
```

### 4. Commit the changes

Lastly, commit the changes made by the two steps above to your repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'Fix formatting issues'
git push origin main
```

You are now ready to start development on your project!

## Releasing a new version

This project uses [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/) for versioning:

```bash
# Commit using conventional format
make commit
# OR use git commit manually: "feat: add new feature"
# OR use the VSCode Conventional Commits extension (search "Conventional Commits" in the Extensions panel)

# When ready to release
make bump              # Bumps version, updates CHANGELOG.md, creates tag
git push --follow-tags # Push changes and tags
```

### Conventional Commit Format

- `feat:` — New features (minor version bump)
- `fix:` — Bug fixes (patch version bump)
- `docs:` — Documentation changes
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` — Breaking changes (major version bump)
- Other types: `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `refactor:`, `revert:`, `style:`, `test:`

### Recommended PR Strategy

For the cleanest commit history and changelog generation, configure your GitHub repository to use **squash merging**:

1. Go to **Settings → General → Pull Requests**
2. Enable **Allow squash merging**
3. Set **Default commit message** to **Pull request title**
4. Optionally disable merge commits and rebase merging to enforce squash-only merges

With this setup, PR titles (which must follow the conventional commit format and are linted by the `pr-title` workflow) become the squash commit messages that Commitizen parses to generate the changelog.

The project is set up to publish to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) automatically when a new release is created on GitHub.

**Setup (one-time)**

1. Create an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and generate an API token under *Account settings → API tokens*.
2. Add the token to your repository secrets as `PYPI_TOKEN`: go to
   `https://github.com/NeyasG/ng-wc/settings/secrets/actions/new`
   and create a secret named `PYPI_TOKEN` with your token as the value.

**Publishing a new version**

1. Bump the version in `pyproject.toml` to match the release tag (e.g. `version = "0.2.0"`).
2. Commit the change and push to `main`.
3. Create a [new release](https://github.com/NeyasG/ng-wc/releases/new) on GitHub with a tag in the form `*.*.*` (e.g. `0.2.0`).

GitHub Actions will automatically build the package with `uv build` and publish it to PyPI using the `PYPI_TOKEN` secret.
